## Installation

You need to have [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) installed on your computer. If you don't, install Node from the website and install Gulp from the command line :

	npm install -g gulp

You may need to run `sudo` depending on your OS, or run the command shell as an Admin (for Windows users).

Download and install files in the directory where you want to work. Just install the Gulp dependencies by running the following command in your project folder :

	npm install
